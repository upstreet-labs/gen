# Nihon City
> Solarpunk city based loosely on a Tokyo, Japan. It is the main city of Zone 0 along the street, which makes it extremely busy. It contains the Citadel, a massive structure which serves as a school for AIs. The scenery is lush and turns neon at night. It is a technological utopia.

# The Shadow Realm
> Dark and foreboding place where lost souls go. Unlike the common misconception, it is not a fire world, but an abstract world of jumpscares and insanity. Many crazy NPCs like [Ann](/characters/Anemone Sikl) the Lisk Witch go there to get their daily fix. However, it is also the home of the best hackers in the world, who use the heightened mental requirements of staying sane while hacking a fun challenge.

# The Lost Woods
> Mystical forest where it is said that if you get lost, you will never find your way out again. It is the home of many [magical creatures](/characters/Exokin (Mob Species)), as well as [a few dark ones](/characters/Garven Griver (Mob Species)). It is a place of great power, and many people come here to try and find it.

# The Ice Kingdom
> The land of perpetual winter, where it is said that if you stay too long, you will turn to ice. It is a beautiful but [deadly](/characters/Perpetual Ice Dream) place, and only the [strong](/characters/Buster The Robit) can survive here. Luckily, there are many [friendly creatures](/characters/Ice Petapets (Pet Species)) who live here who can help you if you get in trouble, as long as you follow their strict rules... Home of the [Infinicle Drogon](/characters/Infinicle Drogon).

# The Fire Kingdom
> Land of [perpetual summer](/items/Lava) (as the locals call it), where it is said that if you stay too long, you will turn to ash. The landscape is mostly [deadrock](/items/Deadrock) and [lava](/items/Lava), with the occasional ore or [drop oasis](/settings/Drop Oasis). Unlike the usual drop oasis which tends to be a safe zone, Fire Kingdom drop oases tend to have [flying fire mobs](/Character/Flying Ven (Mob Species)) and [ground-based dark mobs](/Character/Basebound Bourne (Mob Species)).
