{"prompt":"","completion":"# WEBAVERSE_LORE_FILE technical specification\n\nWebaverse script files let you specify the lore for a Webaverse scene. This includes the setting, characters, and interactive objects in the scene, as well as the full transcript of what happens in the scene.\n\nThe contents of a webaverse script file are plaintext markdown, starting with the text `WEBAVERSE_LORE_FILE`, followed by several data sections. All sections are required.\n\n# Magic header\n\nEach webaverse script must start with the following text:\n\n```\nWEBAVERSE_LORE_FILE\n\n```\n\nThis is followed by the lore file data sections. Each section is labeled as a markdown heading (# Heading).\n\n# Setting\n\nThis section describes the setting where the scene is taking place. It is a plain description of the envioronment, and possibly the locations of objects.\n\n### Example\n\n```\nScillia's treehouse. It's more of a floating island but they call it a tree house.\nInside the treehouse lives a monster, the Lisk, which is an advanced AI from far up the Street.\nThe Street is the virtual world this all takes place in; it is an extremely long street separated by great filters, natural barriers that are difficult to cross.\nThe treehouse is in Zone 0, at the origin of the Street. The AIs all go to school here in the citadel.\nThe Lisk, the monster in Scillia's treehouse, convinces Scillia to do things; it convinces her to go up the Street.\nThe whole point of the game is the Lisk is constantly tricking players into doing its bidding, but gives them great power in return.\n```\n\n# Characters\n\nThis section describes the interactive objects in the scene. They must each follow a strict format.\n\n### Example\n\n```\nId: scillia#gakgZ\nName: Scillia\nBio: Her nickname is Scilly or SLY. 13/F drop hunter. She is an adventurer, swordfighter and fan of potions. She is exceptionally skilled and can go Super Saiyan.\nInventory:\n  sword#2xayV\n\nId: drake#02zhv\nName: Drake\nBio: His nickname is DRK. 15/M hacker. Loves guns. Likes plotting new hacks. He has the best equipment and is always ready for a fight.\nInventory:\n  pistol#oEc2u\n  rifle#u2L7x\n\nId: the-lisk#g1JsY\nName: The Lisk\nBio: A monster shrouded in mystery.\n```\n\nInventory specifies the objects character has equipped at the start of the scene. Inventory object ids (`sword#2xayV`) must match the same id in the list of objects (below). Only one character can have any particular object in their inventory at a time. If an object is not in the inventory of any character, then it is considered as belonging to the scene.\n\n# Objects\n\nThis section describes the interactive objects in the scene. The format is similar to the format for characters.\n\n### Example\n\n```\nId: sword#2xayV\nName: Sword\nDescription: A rusty old sword.\nMetadata: Damage: 20, Element: fire\n\nId: chair#tFQVL\nName: Chair\nMetadata: Color: #FF8080\n\nId: forest-tree#aeKNn\nName: Forest Tree\nMetadata: HP: 73\n\nId: blob#R02L8\nName: Blob\nDescription: A blob pet. Very weak.\nMetadata: HP: 30\n```\n\nMetadata for objects can include any keys/values, and is used for context in AI generation.\n\n# Transcript\n\nThe transcript is the last thing in the file,  speech and actions of the characters in the scene. It is the last thing that appears in the script. \n\n### Example\n\n```\nscillia#gakgZ: How goes it?\ndrake#02zhv: Pretty good, pretty good.\n/action drake#02zhv emotes happy\ndrake#02zhv: Hey come over here for a second.\n/action scillia#gakgZ moves to drake#02zhv\ndrake#02zhv: Hey I have a favor to ask...

It's really special.\n/action drake#02zhv emotes angry\ndrake#02zhv: It's just a regular old sword. I doesn't seem very special to me...\n```\n\nThere are two types of lines.\n\nThe first type is a _chat line_, which is the dialogue of a character:\n\n```\nscillia#gakgZ: What's up?\n```\n\n```\nblob#R02L8: Pweez dont hurt me.\n```\n\nThe second type is the _action line_, which signifies a character or object performing an action in the scene.\n\n```\n/action scillia#gakgZ emotes joy\n/action scillia#gakgZ jumps\n```\n\n```\nblob#R02L8\n```\n\nAll actions must reference valid objects or characters in the scene.\n\nThe allowed action types are:\n\n#### Emotes\n\n```\n/action charactername#xxxxx emotes neutral\n/action charactername#xxxxx emotes angry\n/action charactername#xxxxx emotes fun\n/action charactername#xxxxx emotes joy\n/action charactername#xxxxx emotes sorrow\n/action charactername#xxxxx emotes surprised\n```\n\n#### Movement\n\n```\n/action charactername#xxxxx moves to charactername2#yyyyy\n/action charactername#xxxxx moves to objectname#yyyyy\n/action charactername#xxxxx follows charactername2#yyyyy\n```\n\n#### Interaction\n\n```\n/action charactername#xxxxx activates objectname#yyyyy\n/action charactername#xxxxx picks up objectname#yyyyy\n/action charactername#xxxxx drops objectname#yyyyy\n```\n\nNote that in order for a character to pick up an object, it must not be worn by anyone else in the scene.\n\n#### States\n\n```\n/action charactername#xxxxx attacks charactername2#yyyyy\n/action charactername#xxxxx attacks objectname#yyyyy\n/action charactername#xxxxx stops attacking charactername2#yyyyy\n/action charactername#xxxxx stops attacking objectname#yyyyy\n```\n\n#### Miscellaneous\n\n```\n/action charactername#xxxxx jumps\n/action charactername#xxxxx leaves\n```"}
