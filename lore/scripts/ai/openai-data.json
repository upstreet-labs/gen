It's cursed. When the board of education decided to use our building for an academy. They found this spot, and because the building is a historical landmark, technically and legally and I'm sure scientifically the spot can't actually be removed. Those who touch the spot have an overpowering stench that taints them from ever being popular or having friends again. \n- Yona: Fine by me. \n- YONA is just about to press her finger into the spot before…. \n- Mhysa: Hey!
